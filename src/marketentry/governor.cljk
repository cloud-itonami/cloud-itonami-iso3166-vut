  "Market-Entry Compliance Governor -- the independent compliance layer
  that earns the MarketEntry-LLM the right to commit. The LLM has no
  notion of Republic of Vanuatu procurement law, whether a claimed
  engagement fee actually equals base + months x rate, whether the
  engagement's own declared contract value actually qualifies it for
  the Government Contracts and Tenders Act [CAP. 245]'s own s.3(4)
  low-value-procurement track it declares, whether a Tax Administration
  Act No. 37 of 2018 tax clearance certificate has been verified for a
  filing that requires it, or when a draft stops being a draft and
  becomes a real-world Central Tenders Board submission, so this MUST
  be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to
  HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is `:market-entry-compliance-governor`
  (shared family keyword on blueprints).

  This blueprint's own text (docs/business-model.md Trust Controls:
  'any actual portal registration or filing submission requires
  Market-Entry Compliance Governor clearance and always escalates to
  human sign-off'; 'a false or fabricated regulatory-requirement claim
  is a HARD hold') names exactly the checks below.

  Six checks, in priority order, ALL HARD violations: a human
  approver CANNOT override them. The confidence/actuation gate is
  SOFT: it asks a human to look (low confidence / actuation), and the
  human may approve -- but see `marketentry.phase`: for `:stake
  :actuation/draft-filing`/`:actuation/submit-filing` NO phase ever
  allows auto-commit either. Two independent layers agree that
  actuation is always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis                  -- did the jurisdiction proposal cite
                                       an OFFICIAL source
                                       (`marketentry.facts`), or invent
                                       one?
    2. Evidence incomplete         -- for `:filing/draft`/
                                       `:filing/submit`, has the
                                       jurisdiction actually been
                                       assessed with a full evidence
                                       checklist on file?
    3. Low-value-procurement
       ineligible                  -- for `:filing/submit`, when the
                                       engagement declares
                                       `:claims-low-value-procurement?
                                       true` (i.e. it is following the
                                       Government Contracts and Tenders
                                       Act [CAP. 245]'s own s.3(4)
                                       direct-Director-General track,
                                       bypassing Central Tenders Board
                                       review), INDEPENDENTLY recompute
                                       whether the engagement's own
                                       declared `:declared-contract-
                                       value` actually sits below the
                                       s.3(2)/s.3(4) VT 10,000,000
                                       threshold, and HARD-hold if not.
                                       FLAGSHIP check for this vertical
                                       -- a FLAT-VALUE-THRESHOLD
                                       recompute grounded in the Act's
                                       own sections (not a delegated,
                                       unread number), stopping a
                                       filing from evading Central
                                       Tenders Board scrutiny by
                                       misdeclaring its own
                                       procurement-track eligibility.
    4. Engagement fee mismatch     -- for `:filing/submit`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the engagement's own `:claimed-
                                       fee` equals `base-fee +
                                       monthly-rate x monitoring-
                                       months` -- honest reapplication
                                       of the ground-truth-recompute
                                       discipline sibling actors use.
    5. Tax clearance record
       unverified                    -- for `:filing/submit`, when the
                                       engagement declares
                                       `:requires-tax-clearance-record?
                                       true`, INDEPENDENTLY check
                                       `:tax-clearance-record-
                                       verified?`. CONDITIONAL on the
                                       engagement's own ground truth.
                                       Grounded in the Government
                                       Contracts and Tenders Act
                                       [CAP. 245]'s own s.14(2)(e) cross-
                                       reference to the Tax
                                       Administration Act No. 37 of
                                       2018's own s.51 tax clearance
                                       certificate (see
                                       `marketentry.facts`).
    6. Confidence floor / actuation
       gate                          -- LLM confidence below threshold,
                                       OR the op is `:filing/draft`/
                                       `:filing/submit` (REAL acts)
                                       -> escalate.
